# tictactoe
Using object oriented programming in Python to make an AI-playable tic tac toe, and 4x4 adaptation

I programmed an opponent for a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game, and new 4x4 extension in Python and demonstrated its performance against a human player. I chose to improve and adapt code for 3x3 tic tac toe to make the computer unbeatable. And I created a version that is 4x4 tic-tac-toe. You can test it out. I bet you canâ€™t beat my AI!
